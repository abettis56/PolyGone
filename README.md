# PolyGone
My submission to LD51 with the theme "Every 10 seconds"
This is a short 2D platformer where every 10 seconds, you lose an ability.

This was my first time completing a Ludum Dare game jam, so it's a bit of a mess. :/ Had a lot of fun along the way though!

# Here's what I learned from this event:
- Spaghetti code is inevitable with such a short time frame: 
  Your job as the programmer is to minimize it and do damage control on your codebase,
  not to refactor it completely and make it pretty!
- As in a production level codebase, decoupling is your best friend! There's gonna be mess, but if you can localize each mess to
  one or a handful of files, things will be much more manageable.
- Completing a working entry should be _the top priority_. 
  Next jam, my objective is to get an MVP and heavy playtesting day 1
